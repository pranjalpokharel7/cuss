# cuss
Custom CSS library. Brainstorming.

## Makefile

Run the command `yarn run compile` to generate a Makefile that converts all scss files in the sample-sass directory into corresponding css in the `output-css` directory (mkdir). Only written script for linux but I plan to make it cross-platform eventually.
